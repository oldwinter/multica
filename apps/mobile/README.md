# Multica Mobile (iOS and Android)

Expo + React Native client for Multica. Independent from web/desktop — shares types and pure utilities from `@multica/core/`. See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for mobile architecture and development rules; `package.json` records the current dependency versions.

## Android: build a standalone APK

Reuse this client for Android. It uses the same backend, native navigation,
secure token storage, and shared mobile screens. The APK includes the JS
bundle and runs without Metro, Expo Go, an Expo account, or a build service.

Prerequisites: Node 26+, pnpm, JDK 21 (`JAVA_HOME`), and Android SDK
(`ANDROID_HOME`) with platform-tools, platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0,
NDK 27.1.12297006 and CMake 3.22.1. Install dependencies with
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at the repository root.

From the repository root, specify the API and web addresses reachable from
your phone, then run one command:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.your-multica.example \
EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_URL=https://your-multica.example \
pnpm android:mobile:apk
```

The result is `apps/mobile/dist/multica-android.apk`, with a SHA-256 file
alongside it. Transfer the APK to your phone and open it, allowing installation
from that file source when Android asks. Or, with a USB device attached:

```bash
adb install -r apps/mobile/dist/multica-android.apk
```

The default APK targets ARM64 phones running Android 7 or newer. Override
`ANDROID_ARCHITECTURES` with a comma-separated React Native architecture list
when needed (for example `arm64-v8a,x86_64` to also support emulators).
`APP_ENV` defaults to `production`; development and staging keep
separate app IDs. `EXPO_ANDROID_PACKAGE` overrides the Android package ID,
and `ANDROID_VERSION_CODE` sets its positive integer build number.

Addresses are embedded at build time. The script requires both values and
disables dotenv loading to avoid accidentally targeting the official cloud.
For a self-hosted LAN server use its LAN IP, not `localhost`; the phone must
have network access to that server. An HTTP API enables Android cleartext
traffic for that build. Prefer HTTPS for servers reached over the internet.
Re-run the command after changing either address. Prebuild explicitly uses
`--no-clean` (Expo 57 otherwise recreates the native directory), preserving
native build caches while refreshing app configuration and the JS bundle.

The script creates a private signing key once under
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/multica/android-signing/<package-id>`
and reuses it for updates. **Back up this directory**, including its password
file; do not commit or share it. `MULTICA_ANDROID_SIGNING_DIR` can point to a
secured backup location. Deleting the generated `android/` directory does
not delete this signing identity. This workflow produces an APK for direct
installation; publishing to Google Play is a separate release workflow.

For native development, configure `apps/mobile/.env.development.local` as
below and run `pnpm android:mobile` with an emulator or USB device attached.
Android hardware Back dismisses action menus; iOS keeps its native sheets.

## Just want to use it on your phone? (no development)

Multica isn't on the App Store yet — until that changes, anyone who wants it on their iPhone builds from source. One command:

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release
```

This connects to the same backend as `multica.ai`, so your existing account just works.

**Prerequisites**: Mac with Xcode, a free Apple ID added under Xcode → Settings → Accounts, iPhone connected via USB with [Developer Mode enabled](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/ios-developer-mode/). Walk through Expo's [Set up your environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) (pick **Development build → iOS Device**) if any of that is missing.

Xcode signs the build with the "Personal Team" your Apple ID automatically owns — created silently the first time you signed into Xcode, no setup needed. The first build downloads CocoaPods + compiles React Native from source — expect 10–20 minutes. Subsequent builds reuse Xcode's cache.

**If Xcode rejects signing with "No matching provisioning profiles found"** — rare, happens if someone has claimed the default bundle id `ai.multica.mobile` on Apple's developer portal. Pick any reverse-domain you own and re-run:

```bash
export EXPO_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PROD=com.yourname.multica
pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release
```

**If your Apple ID belongs to more than one Apple Developer team** — a personal team plus an employer's, say — the build signs with the first identity it finds, which may not be the team you meant, and it keeps reusing that choice on every later build. Pin the right one (find the id in the Apple Developer Portal under Membership):

```bash
export EXPO_APPLE_TEAM_ID=ABCDE12345
pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release
```

**7-day signing limit**: a free Apple ID signs builds for 7 days. After that, plug back into the Mac and re-run the command to re-sign. An Apple Developer Program account ($99/yr) extends this to 1 year.

Everything below is for app developers — you can ignore the rest if you only wanted a personal install.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm dev:mobile` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | local (`.env.development.local`) |
| `pnpm dev:mobile:staging` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | staging (`.env.staging`) |
| `pnpm dev:mobile:prod` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | production (`.env.production`) |
| `pnpm ios:mobile` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | local |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:staging` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:prod` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | production |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | local |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging:release` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Release (standalone) | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | production |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Release (standalone) | production |

`dev:*` runs Metro only — assumes the matching variant is already installed. `ios:mobile*` does a full native rebuild + install.

Bundle id and display name switch on `APP_ENV` (see `app.config.ts`), so Dev / Staging / Production variants can coexist on the same device or simulator.

## First-time setup

`.env.staging` is committed (public staging URL). `.env.development.local` is gitignored — copy the template once:

```bash
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env.development.local
# then edit EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL inside it to your Mac's LAN IP, e.g. http://192.168.1.42:8080
```

If your Apple ID isn't on the Multica Apple Developer team yet, also uncomment and set `EXPO_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_DEV` to a reverse-domain you own (e.g. `com.yourname.multica.dev`). This **only** overrides the dev variant — staging / production bundle ids are intentionally not overridable so variants can coexist.

If your Apple ID belongs to more than one Apple Developer team, also set `EXPO_APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the team that should sign your builds. Unlike the bundle id overrides it applies to every variant, and it is re-applied on each run — so it also fixes a checkout that has already latched onto the wrong team.

## Build it onto your iPhone

Two paths, depending on what you want to do:

### Day-to-day development (Mac in front of you)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging
```

Produces a **Debug build** with `expo-dev-launcher` embedded. Every launch the app probes Metro on your Mac and pulls fresh JS — perfect for hot-reload, painful when the Mac is asleep or you're on a different WiFi.

### Standalone / "just use it" (walk away from the Mac)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging:release
```

Produces a **Release build**. No `expo-dev-launcher`, no Metro probe, no "Downloading…" screen. Splash → app, exactly like an App Store install. Trade-off: every JS change requires re-running this command.

Both paths share the same prerequisites: Mac with Xcode, free Apple ID added under Xcode → Settings → Accounts, iPhone connected via USB with Developer Mode enabled. Follow Expo's [Set up your environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) — pick **Development build → iOS Device** — if any of that is missing.

First build of either variant downloads CocoaPods + compiles React Native from source — expect 10-20 minutes. Subsequent builds reuse Xcode's DerivedData cache.

## Try it in the iOS Simulator (no iPhone needed)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:staging
```

Boots the simulator, builds, installs the dev-client. Faster to iterate than a device build because no signing / provisioning step. Same `dev:mobile:staging` Metro flow afterward.

## 7-day signing limit (device only)

A free Apple ID signs builds for **7 days only**, Debug and Release both. After that the app refuses to launch on the iPhone. Plug back into the Mac and re-run the corresponding `ios:mobile:device*` script to re-sign. Simulator builds are unaffected. The only workaround for the device limit is an Apple Developer Program account ($99/yr), which extends to 1 year.

## Pointing at a different backend

Edit `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.staging`, `.env.production`, or `.env.development.local` (whichever variant you're running). Then:

- For an installed **Debug build**: restart Metro (`pnpm dev:mobile:staging`) so the next JS bundle picks up the new value.
- For an installed **Release build**: re-run the `ios:mobile:device:staging:release` command — the value is baked into the embedded bundle at build time.

For local backend testing, use your Mac's LAN IP (`ipconfig getifaddr en0`), not `localhost`.
